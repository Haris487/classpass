A program I found out about through Kaiser. As a guest, I really enjoy how clean this gym is. They always have someone maintaining the locker rooms, cleaning the floors, supplying fresh towels. This is something I'm not used to at Fitness 19. The locker room is very spacious, make sure to bring your lock. I love the steam room! The shower room is clean, no issues. This is a two story facility. For weights, you go upstairs. Cardio is downstairs. I've attended two classes: Zumba and Cycling. By far, cycling is my favorite, I've since then purchased cycling shoes. Great room, with black lights, nice speaker system, it's awesome!!! The zumba class, is very crowded, and I can't connect with the instructors. My friend teaches Zumba, her style is much more understandable then the ones at Crunch. In closing, this place is a treat, something I look forward to."},{"author":{"name":"Robert G.","location":"Elite 2023"},"text":"Living in San Mateo, I was trying to figure out a gym that has it all that isn't too expensive but also doesn't feel run down. I visited a few gyms in the area and settled on Crunch as fitting my criteria. Signing up was super easy and hours are flexible so it's always open when I need to get a workout in.The gym itself is kept pretty clean, as I usually always see cleaning crews around while I'm working out. Everyone is respectful and has the same mindset of being there to get a good workout in. Cardio machine are all downstairs and the weights are all upstairs. There's a cycling room downstairs and a workout/class studio upstairs. The locker rooms/bathrooms are pretty clean and I've never had an issue with them. Front desk staff is always inviting when I come in the morning. This location is also convenient located next to a couple coffee shops and restaurants."},{"author":{"name":"Karen W.","location":"San Francisco, CA"},"text":"This is a shout recommendation for a new circuit training  class that Crunch is offering Mondays/Wednesdays @ 9 a.m.Leona, our teacher is so knowledgeable and welcoming to everyone in the class. I have a tear in my rotator cuff and she works with me in modifying any of the stations I cant do.On top of that she has wonderful music and we all encourage each other to do our best!I highly recommend Leona's Monday/Wednesday circuit training @ 9 a.m.!"},{"author":{"name":"Gigi G.","location":"San Mateo, CA"},"text":"San Mateo is one of my favorite gyms in all of the Bay Area! Best staff in Daly city but too many people there hard to get on equipment. But the San Mateo crunch, is incredibly clean, loaded with great equipment that works. I don't care much for this training locations staff though. They talk a lot of shit about the people they train in the gym. I've witnessed it myself. Who does that! Do better Crunch!"},{"author":{"name":"Raymond L.","location":"Redwood City, CA"},"text":"This is a great gym to go to. The staff were very professional and the atmosphere in the gym is just amazing.
